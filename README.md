# Project Overview

In this project a web-based application that reads RSS feeds is tested. Several test suites are written using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


# Test suites in the project

Test suites can be found at jasmine/spec/feedreader.js  

1. Test suite "RSS Feeds"  
  - A test that ensures all RSS feeds are defined.  
  - A test that ensures all feeds url are defined and not empty.  
  - A test that ensures all feeds names are defined and not empty.  

2. Test suite "The menu"  
  - A test that ensures the menu is hidden by default.  
  - A test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.  

3. Test suite "Initial Entries"  
  - A test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container.  loadFeed() is asynchronous, so this test will require the use of Jasmine's beforeEach and asynchronous done() function.  
  
4. Test suite "New Feed Selection"  
  - A test that ensure when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.
